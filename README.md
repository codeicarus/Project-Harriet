# iBird: A Web3 Social Media Platform on Hedera Hashgraph

[iBird](https://ibird.io/) is a fully functional Web3 social media platform operating on Hedera Hashgraph built by [iAssets](https://iassets.org/). It offers users an opportunity to join, create an account, and post messages directly on the Hedera Network. Not only messages, iBird writes all user interactions including posting, liking, and commenting on a unique Hedera Consensus Service ([HCS Topic](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/topic/0.0.1290501)).

## iBird Explorer 

**iBird Explorer** is an open-source tool providing you the freedom to retrieve and read messages from the iBird social media platform, even when the website is offline. iBird stores all these user actions securely on Hedera's robust network where every post carries a unique hash, thus allowing users to prove the ownership of their content.

By using iBird Explorer ([GitHub link](https://github.com/iassetsorg/ibird-explorer)), you can enter the hash of a message or content item and retrieve the corresponding content directly from the Hedera Network, ensuring permanent availability irrespective of the iBird website status.

## Project Harriet: The Journey Towards Decentralization

**Project Harriet** is on a mission to redefine social media by making iBird 100% open source and 100% decentralized. It marks the dawn of a new era in social networking, leveraging cutting-edge Web3 technologies on Hedera Hashgraph.

The ultimate goal is to foster a rapid, transparent, and decentralized social network, solidifying user's control on their data.

### Project Building Blocks
- **Writer**: The interface for content creation including posts, comments, or any other user interactions.
    
- **Reader**: The data retrieval system which fetches the content from HCS, coupled with regular pull operations to keep the user data in sync.

### To Do List

This document outlines the main steps we need to carry out to move our project forward. This is a living document and will be updated as we make progress and refine our plans. Each step is marked as an unresolved checkbox, which we will be checking off as we complete each task.

## Phase 1: Project Foundations
- [x] Set up version control system (GitHub repository)
- [ ] Design the structure of the application
- [ ] Determine technology stack to be used for development

## Phase 2: Development
- [ ] Implement the base structure of the application
    - [ ] Set up boilerplate code and directories
    - [ ] Determine and implement main classes or components
    - [ ] Establish data flow and state management within the application
- [ ] Build out the user interface
    - [ ] Design UI Mockups and layout
    - [ ] Implement static UI elements
    - [ ] Make the UI interactive

## Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for individual functions or components
- [ ] Write integration tests that cover multiple areas of the application working together
- [ ] Perform end-to-end (E2E) testing
- [ ] Test on multiple platforms and environments (e.g., different browsers and devices)

## Phase 4: Deployment
- [ ] Set up the hosting/server environment
- [ ] Deploy the application to the hosting/server environment
- [ ] Carry out final acceptance testing in live environment

## Phase 5: Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor the performance
- [ ] Fix any bugs
- [ ] Make improvements as necessary
- [ ] Implement user feedback

## Phase 6: Future features and improvements
- [ ] Identify new features to add to the application
- [ ] Prioritize new features, taking into account user feedback and business needs
- [ ] Iterate the phases (Phase 2 to 5) for each of these new features
